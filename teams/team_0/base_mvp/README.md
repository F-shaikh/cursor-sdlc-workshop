# Base MVP

This folder is where your project code lives.

## Phase 2: Design (One Person)

**One team member** creates the base MVP here. This is the foundation everyone else builds on.

### What to Build
- A minimal, working version of your project
- Should run locally and do *something* visible
- Keep it simple — 10 minutes max!

### Good Examples
- A Chrome extension with one button that does one thing
- A web page with basic HTML/CSS/JS
- A simple CLI script

### Instructions

1. Read the `prd.md` in your team folder
2. Use Cursor to generate the base MVP
3. Put all the code files here
4. Make sure it runs locally before committing

### After You're Done

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "[Team] - Base MVP scaffold"
git push origin [team]/base-mvp
```

Then open a PR and merge it so your teammates can build on top of it!
