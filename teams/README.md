# Team Folders

Welcome to the SDLC Workshop!

## Claiming Your Team Folder

There are **20 team slots** available: `team_0` through `team_19`.

**Your team needs to claim one of these folders.**

### How to Claim

1. Pick an unclaimed team number (coordinate with your team!)
2. Add your team members to `teams/team_X/members/`
3. Create your PRD and project files in your team folder

### ⚠️ Warning

Multiple teams might try to claim the same folder at the same time. If that happens... well, that's what merge conflicts are for! 

This is a learning experience. Good luck!

## Folder Structure

Each team folder contains:

```
teams/team_X/
├── base_mvp/                    # Your project code goes here
│   └── .gitkeep
├── github_command_cheatsheet.md # Git commands reference
├── members/                     # One file per team member
│   ├── alice.md
│   ├── bob.md
│   └── ...
└── prd.md                       # Your Product Requirements Document
```

## What's Already There

- **`prd.md`** — Instructions and template for your project specification. Fill this in!
- **`github_command_cheatsheet.md`** — Quick reference for all the git commands you'll need
- **`base_mvp/`** — Put your actual project code here
- **`members/`** — Each team member creates their own file here
