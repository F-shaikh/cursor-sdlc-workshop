# Notflix - Section 3 Projects

This folder contains 4 copies of the "Notflix" project for Section 3 of the workshop.

## What's Going On?

In Section 3, **4 large teams (~20 people each)** all work on the **same ugly codebase**. Each team gets their own copy:

- `notflix_team_a/` — Team A's copy
- `notflix_team_b/` — Team B's copy
- `notflix_team_c/` — Team C's copy
- `notflix_team_d/` — Team D's copy

## The Challenge

With 20 people all trying to improve the same codebase:
- **Communication is key** — who's working on what?
- **Merge conflicts will happen** — that's the point!
- **Small changes win** — big rewrites cause chaos

## The Data

Each team's copy has identical data in the `data/` folder:
- `movies.json` — 15 movies with tons of metadata
- `tv_shows.json` — 12 TV shows with episode info
- `users.json` — User profiles, watch history, preferences
- `categories.json` — Genres, ratings, subscription tiers

## Feature Ideas

The data supports MANY possible features. Teams can:

**UI Features:**
- Dark theme
- Card layouts
- Hero banners
- Category rows
- Responsive design

**Filtering:**
- By genre
- By rating
- By year
- Kids mode (child-safe only)
- Search

**User Features:**
- Profile page
- My List
- Continue watching
- Watch history
- Recommendations

**Content Features:**
- Detail modals
- Star ratings
- Cast info
- Awards
- Trailers

## Rules

1. The data files are **read-only** — don't modify the JSON
2. Make **small, focused changes**
3. **Coordinate** with your team to avoid conflicts
4. **Commit early and often**
5. **Open PRs** so others can review

May the best team build the least ugly Notflix! 🎬
